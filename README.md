# Phylogenetic Tree Generator ðŸ§¬

PhyloGenix is a Python based program that generates phylogenetic trees from sequence data in FASTA format. It leverages sequence alignment and evolutionary distance calculations to construct trees using UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining algorithm methods.
<br><br>

## Features
- Parses sequence data from **FASTA** files
- Computes **pairwise evolutionary distances** using sequence alignment
- Supports tree construction via **UPGMA** and **Neighbor-Joining** algorithms
- Provides **ASCII** and **graphical** visualizations of the phylogenetic tree
- Outputs the tree in **Newick** format for further analysis
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

## Understanding the Methods Behind the Program

### What is a FASTA File?
A FASTA file is a text-based format for representing nucleotide or protein sequences. Each sequence starts with a header line 
**(beginning with >)**, followed by one or more lines of sequence data.

**Example Format:**
```plaintext
>sequence_1
ATCGATCGATCG
>sequence_2
GCTAGCTAGCTA
```
FASTA files are commonly used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.

### UPGMA vs. Neighbor-Joining Algorithms

#### Key Differences:
| Feature            | Unwighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)                              | Neighbor-Joining (NJ) |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Methodology**   | Assumes a **molecular clock**, meaning all lineages evolve at a constant rate. | Does **not** assume a molecular clock, allowing for varying rates of evolution. |
| **Tree Type**     | Produces an **ultrametric tree**, where all leaf nodes are equidistant from the root. | Produces an **additive tree**, where branch lengths reflect evolutionary distance. |
| **Accuracy**      | Works best for **data with equal mutation rates** across lineages. | More flexible and accurate for **real-world biological data** with different mutation rates. |
| **Visualization** | The tree appears more **balanced and uniform** due to the equal evolutionary rates assumption. | The tree may appear **asymmetric**, reflecting varying rates of evolution across species. |
<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### How This Affects Visualization:
- **UPGMA Trees**: Tend to look more **symmetrical**, as all taxa are assumed to have evolved at the same rate.
- **NJ Trees**: Can appear **asymmetrical**, as taxa with different mutation rates will have branches of varying lengths.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

### Newick (NHX) Format  

The **Newick format** is a standard text-based notation for representing phylogenetic trees. It expresses evolutionary relationships using a **nested, parenthetical format** where taxa are enclosed in parentheses and branch lengths are represented as numbers.  

#### **Example Format:**  
```plaintext
(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);
```
In this example:
- A and B share a common ancestor, with branch lengths 0.1 and 0.2.
- C and D share a common ancestor, with branch lengths 0.3 and 0.4.
- The root node connects all branches at a distance of 0.5.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Newick format is widely used in phylogenetics for storing and exchanging tree structures across different bioinformatics tools.
